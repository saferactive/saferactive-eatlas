### Run locally

This is how we expect you to run this repo:

1. Clone the repo and change directory into it
```{r check}
library(geoplumber)
gp_is_wd_geoplumber()
```
2. In R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```
3. Again in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install latest from github
library(geoplumber) 
gp_plumb(host = "0.0.0.0", port = 80)
```
At this moment, your `http://localhost` or `http://0.0.0.0`, if nothing else is blocking port `80` should be showing something like this (assuming no local env or tiles have been added):

If the default browser tab opened and not loading, reload and it must work. That is an issue for package `geoplumber` to deal with.

Read on for more.

### Development
The front end is an npm package, so if you do not need the backend, having cloned the repo:

```{js}
npm i # or yarn
# and run
npm start
```

This is what you should see at `localhost:3000`:

The frontend is a [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA) so all the standard commands of CRA appliees.

### full stack 
The application is a [geopumber](https://github.com/ATFutures/geoplumber) app. That means it is an R powered backend API (think Flask in Python) and a ReactJS front end.

To build the frontend if never built before, from an R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```

Then you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install latest from github
library(geoplumber) 
gp_plumb(host = "0.0.0.0", port = 80)
```

notice we bind the default port of 8000 to :80 to match what is in `Constants.js` as production URL because we are using the `build` folder, you can now visit `http://localhost` which is pointing to port `80` by default.

OR you could `Rscript run.R` which uses the same port and host values.

OR you could `Rscript run.R`

Pleasee note:
* if you like to use Mapbox tiles, you can use a Mapbox API key in `.env.local` file using variable name:
`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'API_KEY'`

* in production one must change the `PRD_URL` in the `Constants.js` file and *use Docker*.

### Docker for production

Repo contains Dockerfile for production. This is again WIP. 

```{sh, eval= FALSE}
# Dockerfile manages your npm/React build steps
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN is required but app should run
docker build -t eatlas .
# note: here we bind internal 8000 to external (host machine)'s 8001.
# The reason for internal 8000 is in the Dockerfile we use 8000 as the plumber port. 
# It is your choice how you want to do this.
docker run -d -p 8000:8001 --name eatlas eatlas

Use your favourite document server (nginx for example) to proxy requets (more later hopefully).
