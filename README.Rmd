### Run locally

This is how we expect you to run this repo:

1. Clone the repo and change directory into it
```{r check}
library(geoplumber)
gp_is_wd_geoplumber()
```
2. In R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```
3. Again in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install latest from github
library(geoplumber) 
gp_plumb()
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

If the default browser tab opened and not loading, reload and it must work. That is an issue for package `geoplumber` to deal with.

Read on for more.

### Development

#### typical environment
 
1. Start background process by running:
`Rscript run.R` which starts the backend at `localhost:8000`
2. Start front end separately by running:
`npm start`

Then use `localhost:3000` as you edit front end. You can use `localhost:8000` if you like to see the API endpoints such as `localhost:8000/api/stats19`.

#### Front only
The front end is an npm package, so if you do not need the backend, having cloned the repo:

```{js}
npm i # or yarn
# and run
npm start
```

This is what you should see at `localhost:3000`:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/88171123-b9656c00-cc16-11ea-8aed-bdd56fa8d17e.png" width="100%" />
The frontend is a [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA) so all the standard commands of CRA appliees.

#### Full stack 
The application is a [geopumber](https://github.com/ATFutures/geoplumber) app. That means it is an R powered backend API (think Flask in Python) and a ReactJS front end.

To build the frontend if never built before, from an R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```

Then you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install latest from github
library(geoplumber) 
gp_plumb()
```

notice we bind the default port of 8000 matches what is in `Constants.js` as production URL because we are using the `build` folder, you can now visit `http://localhost:8000`.

OR you could `Rscript run.R` which uses the same port and host values.

Pleasee note:
* if you like to use Mapbox tiles, you can use a Mapbox API key in `.env.local` file using variable name:
`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'API_KEY'`

* in production one must change the `PRD_URL` in the `Constants.js` file and *use Docker*.

## Docker for production

Repo contains Dockerfile for production. This is again WIP. 

```{sh, eval= FALSE}
# Dockerfile manages your npm/React build steps
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN is required but app should run
docker build -t eatlas .
# note: here we bind internal 8000 to external (host machine)'s 8001.
# The reason for internal 8000 is in the Dockerfile we use 8000 as the plumber port. 
# It is your choice how you want to do this.
docker run -d -p 8000:8001 --name eatlas eatlas

Use your favourite document server (nginx for example) to proxy requets (more later hopefully).
